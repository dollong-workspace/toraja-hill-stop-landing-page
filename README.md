## 🤔 The Problem: Hospitality Business Without Digital Presence

Many guesthouses, homestays, and small accommodations are stuck with:

1. **No website at all** — Relying solely on OTAs (Booking.com, Airbnb) that take 15-20% commission.
2. **Generic templates** — Stiff designs that fail to capture the beauty and uniqueness of their place.
3. **Complicated booking process** — Potential guests don't know how to reach out.

> *"If my place is this beautiful, why doesn't my website reflect that?"*
